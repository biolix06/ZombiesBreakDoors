# Zombies Break Doors
This is a simple plugin for the game SCP: Secret Laboratory. It allows SCP-049-2 instances to gather and break down a door together.

## Features
This plugin isn't very complicated, but it:
- Can detect instances of SCP-049-2 near an accessed door.
- Can be configured to change the threshold and detection range of the doors.

## Installation
To install, simply place the ```ZombiesBreakDoors.dll``` in the ```sm_plugins``` folder of your server. It requires Smod2 to function.
