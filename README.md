# Zombies Break Doors
This is a simple plugin for the game SCP: Secret Laboratory. It allows SCP-049-2 instances to gather and break down a door together.

## Features
This plugin isn't very complicated, but it:
- Can detect instances of SCP-049-2 near an accessed door.
- Can be configured to change the threshold and detection range of the doors along with some other things.

## Installation
To install, simply place the ```ZombiesBreakDoors.dll``` in the ```sm_plugins``` folder of your server. It requires Smod2 to function.

## Config note
You can find the config guide on the wiki I added.

## Note
If you get any cool/interesting ideas, please open an issue. I would appreciate it.

Also, I would love to know if any people actually use this plugin.
