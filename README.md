# Zombies Break Doors
This is a simple plugin for the game SCP: Secret Laboratory. It allows SCP-049-2 instances to gather and break down a door together.

## Features
This plugin isn't very complicated, but it:
- Can detect instances of SCP-049-2 near an accessed door.
- Can be configured to change the threshold and detection range of the doors.

## Installation
To install, simply place the ```ZombiesBreakDoors.dll``` in the ```sm_plugins``` folder of your server. It requires Smod2 to function.

## Planned features
- Introduce a delay between a door access and the door breaking. ***ADDED!***
- Choose which doors can be broken down.

## Potential features?
- Change amount of zombies needed per door. (Different health modes for doors?)
- Change delay based on amount of zombies near door.
- Instead of breaking them, just open doors that normally can't be broken. (Surface nuke room for example)
